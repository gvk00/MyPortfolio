# MyPortfolio
simple portfolio website

## Introduction
The portfolio website is a personal project designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background. It serves as a digital representation of my abilities and achievements, tailored to attract potential employers, collaborators, or clients.

## Design Choices
* Color Scheme:
A clean and modern color palette was selected, featuring neutral tones like white and gray, complemented by an accent color for highlights.

* Layout:
The website employs a responsive grid-based layout to ensure compatibility across devices. Sections such as "About Me," "Projects," "Skills," and "Contact" are organized logically, providing an intuitive navigation experience.
